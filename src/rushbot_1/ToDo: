Do Next:

-error when removing soup locations from the list, Solve it! <------ this next! (gave up) (maybe should take out these blockchain communications)

-finish the receiveUpdates() method. It could be worthwhile to have all units know all unit counts in some way.

-keep working on early game strategy

-improve miners pathing and soup production

-start only doing trials on chosen maps
