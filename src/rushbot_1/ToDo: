Just finished: You now have the miners checking the blockchain every 10 rounds for the last 10 rounds
, starting at 10. The miners also send a message to the blockchain when they build a new design school.

To Do: Keep thinking about how to organize the communication and begin filling in the rest of the framework:

---Start by having the miners send a when they build any other type of building. It would be nice to have a fairly
accurate count and memory of all robots and their locations on our team.


-Today's updates: -finished the update unit counts method
                 -now all robots access the blockchain for messages at different rounds, to save on bytecode costs
                       * hq checks every round
                       * miners, landscapers, drones every 10 rounds
                       * buildings: every 20 rounds
                 -the hq is the only robot that keeps track of unit counts, because it will be making the decisions
                 and the individual units dont need to know.
                 -method shootClosestEnemyDrone() in RobotPlayer can be used by netguns and hq
                 -started building the hq defense. also added more hq messages to send to team
