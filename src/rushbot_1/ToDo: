Do Next:

-Finish the receiveUpdates() method

-keep working on early game strategy

-improve miners pathing and soup production

-start only doing trials on chosen maps


Done today:

    -receiveUpdates() works for miners
    -added a method called sendScoutID() that has the HQ choose one of the starting miners
     as a scout and sends their id to the blockchain. This miner is set as a scout until the enemy hq is discovered
    -added a calculateWaterLevels() method
    -wrote a findClosestSoup() method, has yet to be implemented by the miners
