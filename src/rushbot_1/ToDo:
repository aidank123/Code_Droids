Do Next:

-test the receiveUpdates() method. It could be worthwhile to have all units know all unit counts in some way.

-keep working on early game strategy

-improve miners pathing and soup production <------ this next!

-start only doing trials on chosen maps


Done today:

    -had to take out avoiding water method it was causing errors
    -added stuff to transmit soup locations and things, is working decently
